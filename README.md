# Advance_R_Homework-1

### Overview
This project analyzes the iris dataset, which is a widely used dataset in the field of statistics and machine learning. The dataset includes various characteristics of three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. This project specifically focuses on exploring the relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal Width for these species using a scatter plot generated with the `ggplot2` package in R.

### Dataset Description
- **Source:** The iris dataset is part of the datasets package in R.
- **Observations:** 150 total, divided equally among three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica), with each species represented by 50 observations.
- **Features:**
  - Sepal Length (in cm)
  - Sepal Width (in cm)
  - Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

### Requirements
- **R version:** Ensure you have R installed (version 4.0.0 or higher recommended).
- **Packages:** The following R packages are required:
  - `ggplot2`

### Installation
